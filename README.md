# wp_dyn_sponsors

A niche custom html blob made for a specific WordPress site.
Its used to display a list of sponsors with a hover effect,
that reveals a link to the sponsors website and what team they sponsor.

### ! THIS PROJECT WAS CANCELLED BEFORE COMPLETION !
Most features were implemented, but the project was never fully completed.
I neither recommend using this code, nor working on it further.
The code is a mess and its a solution to a problem that can be solved in a much better ways.
Please refrain from using this code unless you really know what you are doing.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm run publish` to build the project.
5. Copy the contents of the `build\bundle.html` into your WordPress Custom HTML block.
6. Create a Code Block in WordPress and paste your configuration into it. (See below for an example)
7. Set the Code Block to be hidden.
8. Save the page.

From now on you can edit the configuration in the Code Block and it will update the sponsors on the page.

## Configuration
See [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KilianSen/wp_dyn_sponsors/refs/heads/master/example_config.json) (outdated)
