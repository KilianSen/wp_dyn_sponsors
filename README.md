# wp_dyn_sponsors

A niche custom html blob made for a specific WordPress site.
Its used to display a list of sponsors with a hover effect,
that reveals a link to the sponsors website and what team they sponsor.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm run bundle` to build the project.
5. Copy the contents of the `build\bundle.html` into your WordPress Custom HTML block.
6. Create a Code Block in WordPress and paste your configuration into it. (See below for an example)
7. Set the Code Block to be hidden.
8. Save the page.

From now on you can edit the configuration in the Code Block and it will update the sponsors on the page.

## Configuration
